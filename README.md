### Project Overview
For this project, an interactive dashboard was created to summarize and graphically display statistics about bacteria present in belly buttons. After parsing JSON data, a web-based dashboard was created to look at collected information. The dashboard allows for the anonymous selection of individual participants based on their "ID". The selection of an ID from the dropdown then filters the data and updates the visuals to reflect pertinent data for that participant. The three visuals provide aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-understand displays of relative Bacteria and associated washing frequecies.
The dashboard was further improved with some stylistic decisions: analagous colors on the graph/gauge/bubble displays, a relevant image in the jumbotron, a more aligned layout, and navagation bar.
